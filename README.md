# MLPLib

- This neural networks framework supports many layers, several loss functions, automatic differentiation for them, several gradient optimization algorithms and a Batch Loader, which makes it possible to create your own MLPs (Multi-Layered Perceptron) and work with them.

- The interface is very similar to pytorch.

- Almost all of the computations are vectorized.

- This Lib was created as a part of AMI HSE DL1 homework.
